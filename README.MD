### Hobbies

I like to play video games:

-League of legend

-Total war warhammer

-Satisfactory and Factorio

But I also like to travel, visiting a capital city for a weekend or wandering the globe on my own or with  a friends.

### You can always count on me when...

If you've had enough and don't feel well, I'll try to make you smile again.

### Funny Story

I was in Brussels with a friend and we drank absinthe all evening with strangers, and woke up in the morning in a car at the North Sea with no memory of how we got there.

### Aventure never waits you
